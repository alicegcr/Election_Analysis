## Challenge Summary 
The script refers to elections, so it can be used to analyze other types of elections, such as presidential elections. 
To do the presidential election analysis, it is necessary to change the variable from county to state, being able to visualize 
the winner in each state. On the other hand, it also can create a new election party variable to observe the votes of parties in each state, 
which can impact the future of public laws in the country.
